# Simple-neural-network
Homework on the discipline computational mathematics

In my homework number five for the computational mathematics course, 
a simple neural network (based on perceptrons) has been implemented 
that colors a figure bounded by two lines in red. 
You can see the result of the program in the image attached to the project.
